# Coldstore App
A store management app I made as a project for my university mobile application development course. The app uses Google's Firebase Cloud Firestore for its database.

## Functions and Screenshots
The app allows three types of users, each with varying levels of authority and functions:

### Owners
The store owner is allowed complete control over the data in the app, they can add and edit items, suppliers and staff members to the database. Schedules can be edited and created, and requests for changing trading schedules can also be responded to. Owners can also place new orders for inventory and respond to existing orders that were shipped by the suppliers, as well as viewing existing inventory and sales reports.

### Staff
The store's staff can view their schedules as well as request and respond to incoming shift trade requests. They can also report a new sale as well as view sales reports.
